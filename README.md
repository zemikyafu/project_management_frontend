## Requirements

Create an interface to represent the requirements of your backend project.

Focus on the following principles:

- Prioritize High-Impact Features

  - Identify and implement the most critical functionalities first.
  - Ensure the interface aligns with the core objectives of the backend project.

- Efficient Time Management

  - Avoid over-investing time in visual styling or non-essential tasks.
  - Address low-priority issues and bugs only after completing high-priority features.

- Clarity and Functionality
  - Design the interface to be user-friendly and intuitive, but don't sacrifice functionality for aesthetics.
  - Document any trade-offs made for prioritization.
